  I was born in 1953 to a central and West Texas ranching family. I
  grew up in that business, attended Texas A&amp;M University from
  1971 to 1975 and acquired a BS in Animal Science. I went back home
  to ranch until 1992.

<p>
  That year, I began working in the <a href="landman.html">petroleum land
  business</a>, and I have spent 25 years dealing with all aspects of
  field land work. My work brought me and my family to the Texas
  Panhandle where I have had the opportunity to work in wind power
  projects more and more over the years, most notably was 250,000
  acres of wind leases for a single project.

<p>
  I've met and worked with good people, and I have joined forces with
  others with similar experience, combining over 100 years in
  ranching, land and wind projects, to solve the land component
  problem for renewable projects. Our extensive network of ranchers,
  farmers and renewable professionals in the Central, West, and North
  Texas, and the Texas Panhandle provide us with the options to
  utilize to the advantage of any project
  developer. Please <a href="/contact.html">contact us</a> to help
  make your renewable project a success.
