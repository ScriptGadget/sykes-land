  I was born in 1953 to a central and West Texas ranching family. I
  grew up in that business, attended Texas A&amp;M University from
  1971 to 1975 and acquired a BS in Animal Science. I went back home
  to ranch until 1992.

<p>
  That year, I began working in the petroleum land business, with the
  help of my brother, an attorney in Midland, TX. I have spent 25
  years dealing with all aspects of field land work. I have been a
  field landman, had my own contract land brokerage business and been
  an in-house landman.

<p>
  I have experience in leasehold, mineral and surface title
  examination and reporting, negotiating lease and mineral purchases,
  document preparation, negotiating and preparing surface use
  agreements, damage settlement and due diligence. As in-house, I
  focused on putting drilling projects together through lease
  acquisition and on to getting drill sites ready to be drilled. I
  have have years of experience in pipeline repair work as the landowner
  liaison and remediation work for transmission lines as well as right
  of way acquisition.

<p>
  While my primary focus is on brokering mineral, leasehold interest,
  ag property and ag business, we have an extensive network in place for
  <a href="/wind.html">renewable siting</a> and performing petroleum
  landwork. Please <a href="/contact.html">contact me</a>. I look forward
  to being a part of your success.
