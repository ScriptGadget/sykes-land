  I was born in 1953, back when a gallon of Gas was 20 cents and a
  brand new car might set you back $1,600. In 1975, I earned my degree
  in Animal Science from Texas A&amp;M University. I put it to work
  ranching with with my family and for myself in NE Schleicher, Menard
  and Runnels Counties where we operated approximately 35 sections of
  farm and ranch land. We had a farming, cow/calf, stocker calf
  operation, and also ran about 1,000 Rambouillett sheep, 1,000
  Spanish goats, 1,000 Angora goats and 500 Suffolk Sheep. We had
  around 20 Quarter Horse mares. We raised, used and competed with
  horses, and Border Collie dogs. Winters, we guided white tail deer
  hunters.
  
<p> In 1993, I began performing petroleum land work and also managed
  all the wildlife resource and hunting on 83,500 acres for Powell
  Ranches, Inc. We called the operation Fort McKavett Outfitters, and
  we handled package hunters and many season lease hunters. Our
  largest customer was Mossy Oak. They brought their licensees and
  film crews out. Suzuki Great Outdoors with Larry Czonka also used us
  as a wildlife resource for hunting and filming.

  I moved my family to the Texas Panhandle in 1997. Here I began to
  focus my attention solely on petroleum
  and <a href="/wind.html">renewable energy land work</a>. I have run
  my own Land Service Brokerage Company with several high profile
  clients and projects. The most notable was the 250,000 acres we
  leased for T. Boone Pickens for what was then the worldâ€™s largest
  wind project. Please <a href="/contact.html">contact me</a> to help
  make your renewable project a success.
  
<p>
  For the last 5 years, I've been focused on work as an in-house
  acquisition specialist and land manager for one of my old clients to
  help manage their acquisition and drilling program. In 24 years I
  have spent a considerable amount of time in all aspects of petroleum
  land work, including damage settlement, remediation, due diligence,
  and mineral acquisition. Most of my work has been as a landman,
  examining title and buying leases. My specialty is acquisition and
  divestiture or brokerage work.

  This year I'm getting back to where I started, in the Ag. business,
  and I am very excited about the opportunity to get back to selling
  and managing agricultural businesses. I earned
  my <a href="https://agbrokersltd.com/">real estate license</a> in
  January of 2016, but I'm still happy to help you broker mineral and
  working interest packages for sellers and/or buyers.

  A gallon of gas is alot more than 20 cents these days and you can
  spend $1,600 on a set of shocks, but some things never change. I
  still work close to the land I love, surrounded by family and
  friends, and I wouldn't trade it for the world.
